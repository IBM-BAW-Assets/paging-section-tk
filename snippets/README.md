This folder includes sample code snippets that are generally reuable or repeated when when setting up ones own coach 
views to use the paging-section-tk assets

    showHideFitlers.js is a function for showing or hiding a filter triggered from the onclick 
    event of a button and loaded inside a deferred section. This goes in a parent CV in which 
    the fitler coach view is configred.

    
    filterSortOnChangeEvent.js is a example function of setting the paging section variables 
    and calling first on the paging section triggering a reload of the data based on the new filter 
    and sort configurations. This goes in a parent or mutual CV that the paging section and fitler 
    coach view reside.
